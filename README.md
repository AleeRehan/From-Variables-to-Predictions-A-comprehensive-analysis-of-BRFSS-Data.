# From Variables to Predictions: A comprehensive analysis of BRFSS Data.
## Description:
This data analytics project explores the realm of stroke risk factors through a detailed examination of the Behavioral Risk Factors and Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The project unfolds in three main phases: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing, and Logistic Regression.

## Key Highlights:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive into the BRFSS dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and outliers. Visualizations and statistical summaries provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of variables related to stroke risk.

2. **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulate and test hypotheses to discern significant associations between various risk factors and the likelihood of stroke. Rigorous statistical tests provide a solid foundation for identifying influential variables.

3. **Logistic Regression:** Employ logistic regression models to build a predictive framework for stroke risk. Explore the predictive power of selected variables in forecasting stroke occurrences.

## Technologies Used:

- Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- Popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy.
- Statistical methods and hypothesis testing techniques.
- Scikit-learn for implementing logistic regression models.

## Outcome:
This project culminates in a holistic understanding of stroke risk factors, derived from a meticulous analysis of the BRFSS dataset. The predictive models established provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers, contributing to the ongoing efforts to mitigate stroke risks and improve public health.
